        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Roasting chicken and potatoes in the oven is a classic Greek meal. Honey mustard is also used in many Greek recipes. Here, two classics combine for a delicious one-pan dinner. The potatoes are melt-in-your-mouth and the honey mustard sauce that magically develops in the pan is so good you may want to drink it!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

            <li>1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice</li>

            <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>

            <li>1/4 cup yellow mustard</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
                
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>

            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

            <li>5 large yellow or gold potatoes, peeled (about 2 1/2 pounds)</li>

            <li>12 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs</li>

            <li>additional honey for serving (optional)</li>
           
          </ul>

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the orange juice, olive oil, mustard, honey, salt, oregano, and black pepper. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Cut each peeled potato into randomly-shaped pieces about 1 to 1 1/2 inches in size.</li>
            <li>Place potatoes in the bowl with orange juice mixture, toss to coat, then scoop into a large roasting pan. Spread out evenly in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Place chicken thighs in the mixing bowl and coat with remaining orange juice mixture.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the roasting pan, setting on top of the potatoes. Pour over any remaining juice mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Check halfway through roasting and add hot water to the pan only if the potatoes are drying out; at the end of roasting there should be only juices in the pan, not too much excess water, so add only as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve with additional honey drizzled over the top of the chicken and potatoes, if desired.</li>
          </ol>
