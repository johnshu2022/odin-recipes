        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is an item that I saw on allrecipes that looked like it might be good.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed</li>
                
            <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped, or to taste</li>
                
            <li>Â½ cup red cooking wine</li>
                
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes</li>
                
            <li>8 ounces small seashell pasta</li>
                
            <li>5 ounces fresh spinach, chopped</li>
                
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
           
          </ul>

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet with a lid over medium heat; cook and stir the chicken and garlic until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour wine and diced tomatoes with their juice into the skillet, and bring to a boil over high heat while scraping any browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Stir in shell pasta and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until shells have cooked through, but are still firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. <br>Spread spinach over the top of pasta, cover, and simmer until spinach leaves are cooked, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly over the skillet; simmer until the cheese has melted and the pasta is bubbling, about 5 minutes.</li>
          </ol>
